        <h4><strong>Should a haven for grizzlies be off limits to hikers?</strong></h4>
        <h5><i>In Montana, a section of the Pacific Northwest Trail has locals and conservationists debating the fate of a forest.</i></h5>

            The Pacific Northwest Trail is a wild wonder that takes hikers through one of America’s few inland temperate rainforests. For 1,200 miles, it winds along the Canadian border, through rugged mountains and gaping valleys in Montana, Idaho, and Washington, until it meets the Pacific Ocean.
            Since it was designated in 2009, the PNT has flown under the radar, compared to other popular long-distance trails, such as the Pacific Crest Trail and the Appalachian Trail. But the roughly 70-mile section of the PNT that runs through Montana’s Yaak Valley is a sore spot, at a time when outdoor spaces across the country have become popular due to the pandemic.
            (The pandemic brought record crowds to America’s national parks.) Conservationists and the Kootenai people say that the PNT threatens endangered grizzlies and Native traditions in the area. But to a handful of locals, the trail provides their only source of income.
            The growing tussle among these groups sheds light on a bigger issue in the realm of conservation. In one of the wildest, most remote places in the contiguous United States, locals grapple with what defines public use, and who gets to decide the fate of a forest.
            Protecting grizzlies
            The brainchild of trail builder Ron Strickland, the PNT almost didn’t come to be. A 1980 U.S. Forest Service report dubbed the trail unnecessary, too expensive, and too dangerous. It concluded that the PNT posed a threat to both grizzlies and caribou (now extinct there). But Strickland was undeterred. He disputed the report’s findings and lobbied for decades to make his youthful hiking dream a reality.
            Now, in-the-know trekkers (only about 75 a year by some estimates) take in “the mountains, the saltwater, the snowy peaks, the adventure, and the excitement,” that Strickland lauded.
            But conservationists worry that soon more adventure-seekers will discover the trail, as the pandemic pushes people to wide, open outdoor spaces. Last summer, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote an op-ed about the trail and broadcast his trek to millions of his social media followers. An adventure documentary about the trail called “Thru” (backed by outdoor gear companies, slated for release this year) is poised to add even more buzz.
            Conservationists say the extra attention sets up a potential clash between hikers and grizzlies. “The Yaak’s alpine meadows are too small for people and bears to share them at the same time,” says writer and Yaak Valley Forest Council advocate Rick Bass, who’s been fighting to protect the valley he’s extolled in several books.

        <h4><strong>Avoid crowds at the 10 least-visited U.S. national parks</strong></h4>
        <h5><i>Social distancing is built into these under-the-radar wilderness areas.</i></h5>

            Since its founding on August 25, 1916, the U.S. National Park Service has assembled 419 protected units, of which 62 hold the “national park” designation. To visit all 62 of these treasures one would need to travel to 29 states and two U.S. territories.
            Such an extensive trip is all but impossible during a pandemic that has closed borders. But with so many national parks to visit, there are trails, craters, and lakeshores that can be explored responsibly and without crowds. Avoid the people—but not the natural wonders—at some of the nation’s least-visited national parks.
            How remote and uncrowded are these parks? Katmai National Park’s Aniakchak caldera is so remote that many park rangers have never visited its volcanic crater. At Kobuk Valley National Park in Alaska, quadrupeds greatly outnumber bipeds (or at least humans); the ratio of caribou to humans was roughly 33 to one in 2018.
            Getting far away from it all has become a pandemic obsession. Although many national parks were closed this past spring due to COVID-19, most of them re-opened for summer season and have experienced a surge in visitation. This popularity brings complications. At many parks, a flood of first-time guests has left a tsunami of litter and graffiti in its wake. Visitors who do not wear masks or abide by social distancing guidelines bring the potential to infect park rangers and other guests.
            Yellowstone National Park, which received more than four million visitors in 2018, counted four-and-a half-million visitors in 2019—and a record-breaking number of cars by mid-August of this year. Remote native communities, which are disproportionately susceptible to viral infection, have been put at risk by visitors from all over the map; earlier this summer, the Blackfeet Nation closed off road access to Glacier National Park’s east entrances in an effort to prevent infection.
            The annual recreational visitor count for all National Park Service (NPS) units increased by some 9 million—from 318.2 million in 2018 to over 327.5 million in 2019. According to Pam Ziesler, who tracks and coordinates NPS visitors statistics, many national parks are still behind in reporting their 2019 visitor statistics (likely due to complications with COVID-19 park closures, staffing disruptions, wildfires, and seasonal hurricanes). Lists of most- and least-visited parks are subject to change.

        <h4><strong>Whales, myths, and Arctic lakes: Explore Iceland’s new road trip</strong></h4>
        <h5><i>An epic drive across the Nordic nation’s less-touristed north reveals breathtaking nature and historic battles on land and sea.</i></h5>
        <p>• 15 MIN READ</p>
        <div class="article-content">

            Iceland is filled with rugged nature and swirling stories—history, legends, and folklore that cover this land as thickly as its winter snows. Until recently, most travelers searched for the island nation’s cultural and natural charms along the Ring Road, the famed 828-mile highway circumnavigating the country. In normal times, Iceland’s most famous highway comes with big thrills—huffing volcanos, exploding geysers—but it also comes with swarms of tourists.
            Not so the recently launched Arctic Coast Way. Created in 2019, it links existing auto routes in Iceland’s rugged north into one epic road trip. For now, it’s still a less-traveled gem of otherworldly basalt cliffs, pebble beaches with basking seals, and utter solitude.
            From May to September, you can rent a car and spend several days traversing the 560-mile route of dirt and paved roads. Winter trips are also possible, but may be impacted by snowfall and other weather-related detours.
            The Arctic Coast Way starts in the village of Hvammstangi and follows the filigreed coastline of seven peninsulas—each with their own geological marvels, stories, and wildlife—ending in the hamlet of Bakkafjörður. Signposts mark the way: a white infinity symbol over a sketched outline of Icelandic territory. Here are some of the drive’s highlights, from whale watching to a Nordic spin on Stonehenge. Most places are open; call ahead to check about COVID-19 related closures.    
            Off-the-beaten-track beauty and historic battles
            Tourism has yet to gain a foothold in these parts, and a four-wheel-drive is obligatory for tackling the gravel tracks. Hvammstangi may be only a half-day’s drive from Reykjavík, but these lonely shores feel a million miles from the capital and the south’s popular geological hotspots.
            “The north won’t change; it’ll never be Reykjavík,” says Dagný Marín Sigmarsdóttir, the proprietor of the Museum of Prophecies in the village of Skagaströnd, about 50 miles northeast of Hvammstangi. The museum explores the history of a legendary 10th-century fortune teller, and Sigmarsdóttir herself can read your palm. “We’d love more travelers to come this way to share the beauty,” she says.
